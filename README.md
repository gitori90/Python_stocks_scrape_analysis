This project scrapes data from eoddata.com,
and saves the data in xlsx files (no databases are used in this project).
In the analysis modules there are analysis and search functions
that work with those data files, and some write the results in
different datafiles.

note that the data files i've gathered werent uploaded to the git,
so the entire project_files folder is empty but for some example files.
